  Solve the Yule-Walker linear system of equations.

  They're given by:

  .. math::

    R . a = r

  where :math:`R` is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix where each element are lags
  from the given autocorrelation list. :math:`R` and :math:`r` are defined

  element):

  .. math::

    R[i][j] = acdata[abs(j - i)]

  Parameters
  ----------
  acdata :
    Autocorrelation lag list, commonly the ``acorr`` function output.
  order :
    The order of the resulting ZFilter object. Defaults to
    ``len(acdata) - 1``.

  Returns
  -------
  A FIR filter, as a ZFilter object. The mean squared error over the given
  data (variance of the white noise) is in its "error" attribute.

  --------
  acorr:
    Calculate the autocorrelation of a given block.
  lpc :
    Calculate the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients.
  parcor :
    Partial correlation coefficients (PARCOR), or reflection coefficients,
    relative to the lattice implementation of a filter, obtained by reversing
    the Levinson-Durbin algorithm.

  Examples
  --------
  >>> data = [2, 2, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

  >>> ldfilt.error # Squared! See lpc for more information about this
