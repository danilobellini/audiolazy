  Stream class. Stream instances are iterables that can be seem as generators
  with elementwise operators.

  Examples
  --------
  If you want something like:

  >>> import itertools
  >>> x = itertools.count()
  >>> y = itertools.repeat(3)
  >>> z = 2*x + y
  Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and ...

  That won't work with standard itertools. That's an error, and not only
  __mul__ but also __add__ isn't supported by their types. On the other hand,
  you can use this Stream class:

  >>> x = Stream(itertools.count()) # Iterable
  >>> y = Stream(3) # Non-iterable repeats endlessly
  >>> z = 2*x + y
  >>> z
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
  >>> z.take(12)
  [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25]

  If you just want to use your existing code, an "itertools" alternative is
  already done to help you:

  >>> from audiolazy import lazy_itertools as itertools
  >>> x = itertools.count()
  >>> y = itertools.repeat(3)
  >>> z = 2*x + y
  >>> w = itertools.takewhile(lambda pair: pair[0] < 10, enumerate(z))
  >>> list(el for idx, el in w)
  [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]

  All operations over Stream objects are lazy and not thread-safe.

  See Also
  --------
  thub :
    "Tee" hub to help using the Streams like numbers in equations and filters.
  tee :
    Just like itertools.tee, but returns a tuple of Stream instances.
  Stream.tee :
    Keeps the Stream usable and returns a copy to be used safely.
  Stream.copy :
    Same to ``Stream.tee``.

  Notes
  -----
  In that example, after declaring z as function of x and y, you should
  not use x and y anymore. Use the thub() or the tee() functions, or
  perhaps the x.tee() or x.copy() Stream methods instead, if you need
  to use x again elsewhere.

  def __init__(self, *dargs):

    Constructor for a Stream.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *dargs:
      The parameters should be iterables that will be chained together. If
      they're not iterables, the stream will be an endless repeat of the
      given elements. If any parameter is a generator and its contents is
      used elsewhere, you should use the "tee" (Stream method or itertools
      function) before.

    Notes
    -----
    All operations that works on the elements will work with this iterator
    in a element-wise fashion (like Numpy 1D arrays). When the stream
    sizes differ, the resulting stream have the size of the shortest
    operand.

    Examples
    --------
    A finite sequence:

    >>> x = Stream(1,2,3) + Stream(8,5) # Periodic constructor
    >>> x
    <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
    >>> x.take(15) # Don't try "tuple" or "list": this Stream is endless!

    ----------
    n :
      Number of elements to be taken. Defaults to None.
      Rounded when it's a float, and this can be ``inf`` for taking all.
    constructor :
      Container constructor function that can receie a generator as input.
      Defaults to ``list``.

    Returns
    -------
    The first ``n`` elements of the Stream sequence, created by the given
    constructor unless ``n == None``, which means returns the next element
    from the sequence outside any container.
    If ``n`` is None, this can raise StopIteration due to lack of data in
    the Stream. When ``n`` is a number, there's no such exception.

    Examples
