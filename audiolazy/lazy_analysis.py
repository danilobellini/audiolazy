@stft.strategy("rfft", "base", "real")
def stft(func=None, **kwparams):
  """
  Short Time Fourier Transform block processor / phase vocoder wrapper.

  This function can be used in many ways:

  * Directly as a signal processor builder, wrapping a spectrum block/grain
    processor function;
  * Directly as a decorator to a block processor;
  * Called without the ``func`` parameter for a partial evalution style
    changing the defaults.

  See the examples below for more information about these use cases.

  The resulting function performs a full block-by-block analysis/synthesis
  phase vocoder keeping this sequence of actions:

  1. Blockenize the signal with the given ``size`` and ``hop``;
  2. Lazily apply the given ``wnd`` window to each block;
  3. Perform the 5 actions calling their functions in order:

    a. ``before``: Pre-processing;
    b. ``transform``: A transform like the FFT;
    c. ``func``: the positional parameter with the single block processor;
    d. ``inverse_transform``: inverse FFT;
    e. ``after``: Post-processing.

  4. Overlap-add with the ``ola`` overlap-add strategy. The given ``ola``
     would deal with its own window application and normalization.

  Any parameter from steps 3 and 4 can be set to ``None`` to skip it from
  the full process, without changing the other [sub]steps. The parameters
  defaults are based on the Numpy FFT subpackage.

  Parameters
  ----------
  func :
    The block/grain processor function that receives a transformed block in
    the frequency domain (the ``transform`` output) and should return the
    processed data (it will be the first ``inverse_transform`` input). This
    parameter shouldn't appear when this function is used as a decorator.
  size :
    Block size for the STFT process, in samples.
  hop :
    Duration in samples between two blocks. Defaults to the ``size`` value.
  transform :
    Function that receives the windowed block (in time domain) and the
    ``size`` as two positional inputs and should return the block (in
    frequency domain). Defaults to ``numpy.fft.rfft``, which outputs a
    Numpy 1D array with length equals to ``size // 2 + 1``.
  inverse_transform :
    Function that receives the processed block (in frequency domain) and the
    ``size`` as two positional inputs and should return the block (in
    time domain). Defaults to ``numpy.fft.irfft``.
  wnd :
    Window function to be called as ``wnd(size)`` or window iterable with
    length equals to ``size``. The windowing/apodization values are used
    before taking the FFT of each block. Defaults to None, which means no
    window should be applied (same behavior of a rectangular window).
  before :
    Function to be applied just before taking the transform, after the
    windowing. Defaults to the ``numpy.fft.ifftshift``, which, together with
    the ``after`` default, puts the time reference at the ``size // 2``
    index of the block, centralizing it for the FFT (e.g. blocks
    ``[0, 1, 0]`` and ``[0, 0, 1, 0]`` would have zero phase). To disable
    this realignment, just change both ``before=None`` and ``after=None``
    keywords.
  after :
    Function to be applied just after the inverse transform, before calling
    the overlap-add (as well as before its windowing, if any). Defaults to
    the ``numpy.fft.fftshift`` function, which undo the changes done by the
    default ``before`` pre-processing for block phase alignment. To avoid
    the default time-domain realignment, set both ``before=None`` and
    ``after=None`` keywords.
  ola :
    Overlap-add strategy. Uses the ``overlap_add`` default strategy when
    not given. The strategy should allow at least size and hop keyword
    arguments, besides a first positional argument for the iterable with
    blocks. If ``ola=None``, the result from using the STFT processor will be
    the ``Stream`` of blocks that would be the overlap-add input.
  ola_* :
    Extra keyword parameters for the overlap-add strategy, if any. The extra
    ``ola_`` prefix is removed when calling it. See the overlap-add strategy
    docs for more information about the valid parameters.

  Returns
  -------
  A function with the same parameters above, besides ``func``, which is
  replaced by the signal input (if func was given). The parameters used when
  building the function should be seen as defaults that can be changed when
  calling the resulting function with the respective keyword arguments.

  Examples
  --------
  Let's process something:

  >>> my_signal = Stream(.1, .3, -.1, -.3, .5, .4, .3)

  Wrapping directly the processor function:

  >>> processor_w = stft(abs, size=64)
  >>> sig = my_signal.copy() # Any iterable
  >>> processor_w(sig)
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
  >>> peek200_w = _.peek(200) # Needs Numpy
  >>> type(peek200_w[0]).__name__ # Result is a signal (numpy.float64 data)
  'float64'

  Keyword parameters in a partial evaluation style (can be reassigned):

  >>> stft64 = stft(size=64) # Same to ``stft`` but with other defaults
  >>> processor_p = stft64(abs)
  >>> sig = my_signal.copy() # Any iterable
  >>> processor_p(sig)
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
  >>> _.peek(200) == peek200_w # This should do the same thing
  True

  As a decorator, this time with other windowing configuration:

  >>> stft64hann = stft64(wnd=window.hann, ola_wnd=window.hann)
  >>> @stft64hann # stft(...) can also be used as an anonymous decorator
  ... def processor_d(blk):
  ...   return abs(blk)
  >>> processor_d(sig) # This leads to a different result
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
  >>> _.peek(200) == peek200_w
  False

  You can also use other iterables as input, and keep the parameters to be
  passed afterwards, as well as change transform calculation:

  >>> stft_no_zero_phase = stft(before=None, after=None)
  >>> stft_no_wnd = stft_no_zero_phase(ola=overlap_add.list, ola_wnd=None,
  ...                                  ola_normalize=False)
  >>> on_blocks = stft_no_wnd(transform=None, inverse_transform=None)
  >>> processor_a = on_blocks(reversed, hop=4) # Reverse
  >>> processor_a([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], size=4, hop=2)
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
  >>> list(_) # From blocks [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 0.0]
  [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 6, 4, 3]
  >>> processor_a([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], size=4) # Default hop instead
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>
  >>> list(_) # No overlap, blocks [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  [4, 3, 2, 1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 5]
  >>> processor_a([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # Size was never given
  Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
  TypeError: Missing 'size' argument

  For analysis only, one can set ``ola=None``:

  >>> from numpy.fft import ifftshift # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
  >>> analyzer = stft(ifftshift, ola=None, size=8, hop=2)
  >>> sig = Stream(1, 0, -1, 0) # A pi/2 rad/sample cosine signal
  >>> result = analyzer(sig)
  >>> result
  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at 0x...>

  Let's see the result contents. That processing "rotates" the frequencies,
  converting the original ``[0, 0, 4, 0, 0]`` real FFT block to a
  ``[4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`` block, which means the block cosine was moved to
  a DC-only signal keeping original energy/integral:

  >>> result.take()
  array([ 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
  >>> result.take() # From [0, 0, -4, 0, 0] to [-4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  array([-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5])

  Note
  ----
  Parameters should be passed as keyword arguments. The only exception
  is ``func`` for this function and ``sig`` for the returned function,
  which are always the first positional argument, ald also the one that
  shouldn't appear when using this function as a decorator.

  Hint
  ----
  1. When using Numpy FFT, one can keep data in place and return the
     changed input block to save time;
  2. Actually, there's nothing in this function that imposes FFT or Numpy
     besides the default values. One can still use this even for other
     transforms that have nothing to do with the Fourier Transform.
