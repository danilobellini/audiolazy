AudioLazy changes history
-------------------------

*** Unreleased ***

+ examples:

  - Make "modulo counter FM" example compatible with wxPython 3+

+ general:

  - Remove Travis CI configuration as it's no longer available
    for open source projects
  - Update tox for testing with CPython 2.7, CPython 3.2~3.10, PyPy and PyPy 3

*** Version 0.6 (Examples, STFT, phon2dB, tox, CI, wave file) ***

  - Musical keyboard synth example with a QWERTY keyboard (also via jack!)
  - Random synthesis with saving and memoization
  - Aesthetics for the Tkinter GUI examples

  - Perceptual experiment with butterworth filters (Scipy) applied to white
    noise (based on the Demonstrations to Auditory Scene Analysis)
  - Psychoacoustics using ISO/FDIS 226:2003

    * Equal loudness contour curves plotting
    * Constant phon chirp playing

  - Partial recreation of the "Windows and Figures of Merit" F. Harris
    comparison table and window plots
  - Playing/synthesizing "Ode to Joy" from its "score" written as code

    API and receiving it as an argument like "jack" or "alsa"
  - Realtime STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) effects:

    * Robotize
    * "Roll" the magnitude spectrum while keeping the phase

+ general:

  - Tox for testing with CPython 2.7, CPython 3.2~3.6 and PyPy
  - Continuous integration wih Travis CI and Coveralls
  - New ``_internals.py`` module to avoid exposing package internals together
    with the API, which also allowed the new simplified ``__init__.py``
  - Renewed setup.py in both its internals (e.g. using AST instead of
    string manipulation to avoid importing the package before installation)
    and its interface (e.g. the ``test`` command now calls ``tox``)
  - New ``conftest.py`` for testing doctests from strategies inside
    StrategyDict instances without the need of a ``__test__`` in the module
    and for skipping doctests known to need Numpy when it's not available
  - New ``math`` directory for adding scripts with symbolic math calculations
    (with Sympy) done for designing (or as a proof) for parts of the
    AudioLazy code. All lowpass and highpass strategies have their design
    explicitly explained there

+ lazy_analysis:

  - New ``overlap_add`` StrategyDict instance, allowing resynth after block
    processing/analysis, featuring block size auto-detection and window
    normalization to keep the output in the [-1; 1] range. Has 2
    implementations keeping the same interface:

    * ``numpy`` (*default*): needs Numpy arrays internally
    * ``list``: uses lists instead, doesn't need Numpy and was tested on Pypy

  - New ``stft`` StrategyDict instance, allowing Short Time Fourier Transform
    block processors / phase vocoder by:

    * Passing a function as the first parameter
    * Using a ``stft`` strategies as a decorator
    * Creating new strategies by avoiding the only positional parameter

    It was created with three Numpy-based strategies:

    * ``rfft``, ``real`` or ``base`` (*default*): needs ``numpy.fft.rfft``
      internally, as well as its inverse, to process a block in the
      frequency domain with values up to the Nyquist frequency, by assuming
      the input signal is real
    * ``cfft`` or ``complex``: Alike to the default approach but uses the
      ``numpy.fft.fft`` for a full complex-valued block in frequency domain,
      which means the output is a complex signal
    * ``cfftr`` or ``complex_real``: same to ``stft.cfft`` strategy, but
      keeps only the real part of the result

    Parameters allows changing the default zero-phase behavior (``before``
    and ``after`` functions), the transform and inverse transform functions,
    the overlap-add strategy (as well as its parameters), and obviously the
    block size and hop

  - The ``window`` StrategyDict now returns the "periodic" window data
    instead of the "symmetric" window to be used with the STFT directly
  - New ``wsymm`` StrategyDict with the same strategies from ``window`` but
    returning a "symmetric" window
  - Default ``window`` strategy is the Hann window (the same for ``wsymm``)
  - New ``cos`` strategy for ``window`` and ``wsymm`` implementing cosine to
    the power of alpha

+ lazy_auditory:

  - New ``phon2dB`` StrategyDict instance with the ISO/FDIS 226:2003 model
    for getting a SPL (Sound Pressure Level) in dBs from a phon value

+ lazy_core:

  - Add support to the new ``@`` matrix multiplication operator
  - ``OpMethod.get()`` now accepts numbers ``"1"`` and ``"2"`` as strings for
    unary and binary query for operators, and ``"all"`` is the new default, so
    ``OpMethod.get(without="2 ~")`` would get all operators but the [reversed
    or not] binary ones and the invert operator, which means it would yield
    only the unary ``"+"`` (pos) and ``-`` (neg), as probably was expected;
    OpMethod also had a bug fix regarding the shift operators
  - Strategy name autocomplete works on IPython since StrategyDict now
    changes its instance dictionary (e.g. ``vars(window)``) instead of
    depending on the ``__getattr__`` method
  - ``StrategyDict.strategy`` method now allows the strategy function name to
    be kept by using the new ``keep_name`` keyword-only argument. It might be
    helpful for adding built-in functions as well as other immutable
    callables as multi-name strategies with the same behavior as the item
    assignment for adding a strategy
  - The default strategy in a StrategyDict instance is now removed when all
    its keys/names are removed. The new default is the next added strategy
  - Strategies can be removed both by their item name and their attribute,
    and removing an attribute that isn't an strategy recovers the strategy
    attribute if its name belongs to a strategy
  - MultiKeyDict methods ``key2keys`` and ``value2keys`` to help getting a
    tuple with all keys that points to the same value, ordered by the
    insertion order

+ lazy_filters:

  - LinearFilter coefficients can now be a Stream of Numpy matrices, as well
    as Sympy symbols (including symbolic matrices).
  - New simple lowpass/highpass IIR filter strategies:

    * ``highpass.z`` (taken as the new ``highpass`` default)
    * ``lowpass.z``
    * ``highpass.pole_exp``
    * ``highpass.z_exp``
    * ``lowpass.z_exp``

    Where the ``"z"`` name denotes the presence of a single zero (besides the
    single pole) and ``"_exp"`` denotes the exponential approximation from
    a matched Z-Transform pole value from the equivalent or mirrored analog
    filter equation (Laplace). The absence of such suffix denotes it was
    designed directly as a digital filter.

+ lazy_io:

  - New ``api`` keyword argument for AudioIO, allowing e.g. integration with
    JACK (for now this needs ``chunks.size = 1``)
  - ``AudioIO.open`` and ``AudioIO.record`` now allows keyword arguments, to
    be passed directly to PyAudio, including the now default "channels"
    keyword (old "nchannels" keyword still works, for backward compatibility)

+ lazy_math:

  - Signal function ``sign`` now works on Python 3

+ lazy_misc:

  - New ``cached`` decorator caching the results for a function without
    keyword arguments

+ lazy_poly:

  - Complex numbers and Sympy symbols can now be used as Poly powers
  - Poly instances are now based on OrderedDict (stores the creation order
    internally) and Poly.terms now support both a ``sort`` and a ``reverse``
    keyword arguments to choose the yielding order (sorted by powers, keep
    creation order or reverse any of these)
  - Immutable Poly behavior is now based on a cached frozenset (doesn't depend
    on the terms order) and includes Poly.zero as a read-only property (after
    the hash is required)
  - The Horner-like polynomial evaluation scheme (which needs sorting) is now
    enabled/disabled via a keyword argument. By default, it's enabled just for
    simple polynomials, but optional when powers are sortable (e.g. in a
    Laurent polynomial)

+ lazy_text:

  - New ``format_docstring`` decorator that use format-style templates to
    assign docstrings to functions, intended to avoid docstring copies on
    StrategyDict instances.

+ lazy_wav (*new!*):

  - ``WavStream`` class for opening Wave files. Can load 24-bit audio files!
    Tested with 8 bits files (unsigned int) and 16/24/32 bits (signed int)
    mono and stereo files, both casting the data to a float in [-1;1) interval
    (default) and keeping the original integer data as it is

+ multiple modules:

  - (*lazy_math and lazy_stream*) Renamed the elementwised ``abs`` to
    ``absolute``, so no Python built-in name is ever replaced when importing
    with ``from audiolazy import *``. Also, the built-in ``abs`` now can be
    used directly with Stream instances
  - (*lazy_analysis and lazy_misc*) Renamed ``freq2lag`` and ``lag2freq`` to
    use ``2`` instead of ``_to_``, and moved them to lazy_misc


*** Version 0.05 (Python 2 & 3, more examples, refactoring, polinomials) ***

    pitch follower by using a simple limiter
  - Butterworth filter from SciPy as a ZFilter instance, with plots

+ general:

  - Now with 82% code coverage in tests
  - Mock testing for audio output
  - Bugfixes (``envelope.abs``, ``midi2str``, ``StreamTeeHub.blocks``, etc.)
  - Extended domain for some functions by using ``inf`` and ``nan``
  - Removed deprecated ``Stream.tee()`` method
  - Constants ``DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`` and ``LATEX_PI_SYMBOL`` were removed:
    the default values are now changeable and inside ``chunks`` and
    ``float_str``, respectively (see docstrings for more details)
  - No more distinction between ``__div__`` and ``__truediv__`` (Python 2.7)
  - Now AudioLazy works with Python 3.2 and 3.3!
  - Test skipping for tests that depends upon something that is Python
    version-specific
  - Test "xfail" using XFailer classes when depending package (e.g. pyaudio)
    is unavailable in the testing environment

+ lazy_compat (*new!*):

  - Module for Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility resources (constants
    and functions) without AudioLazy dependencies (i.e., no Stream here)
  - Common place for iterable-based version of itertools/built-ins in both
    Python 2 and 3 starting with "x": ``xmap``, ``xfilter``, ``xzip``,
    ``xrange``, ``xzip_longest``. Versions with "i" are kept in lazy_itertools
    module to return Stream instances (``imap``, ``izip``, ``izip.longest``,
    etc.), and Python 2 list-based behaviour of ``range`` is kept as
    ``orange`` (a fruitful name)
  - New ``meta`` function for creating metaclasses always in a "Python 3
    look-alike" style, keeping the semantics (including the inheritance
    hierarchy, which won't have any extra "dummy" class)

+ lazy_core:

  - New ``OpMethod`` class with 33 operator method instances and querying
  - Changed ``AbstractOperatorOverloaderMeta`` to the new OpMethod-based
    interface
  - Now StrategyDict changes the module ``__test__`` so that doctests from
    strategies are found by the doctest finder.

+ lazy_filters:

  - ZFilter instances are now better prepared for Stream coeffs and
    operator-based filter creation, as well as a new copy helper method
  - Filters are now hashable (e.g., they can be used in sets)

+ lazy_io:

  - New RecStream class for recording Stream instances with a ``stop`` method
  - Now chunks is a StrategyDict here, instead of two lazy_misc functions
  - Now the default chunk size is stored in chunks.size, and can be changed

+ lazy_itertools:

  - New ``accumulate`` itertool from Python 3, available also in Python 2
    yielding a Stream. This is a new StrategyDict with one more strategy in
    Python 3
  - Strategy ``chain.from_iterable`` is now available (Stream version
    itertool), and ``chain`` is now a StrategyDict
  - Now ``izip`` is a StrategyDict, with ``izip.smallest`` (*default*) and
    ``izip.longest`` strategies

+ lazy_misc:

  - New ``rint`` for "round integer" operations as well as other higher step
    integer quantization
  - Now ``almost_eq`` is a single StrategyDict with both ``bits`` (*default*,
    comparison by significand/mantissa bits) and ``diff`` (absolute value
    difference) strategies

+ lazy_poly:

  - New ``x`` Poly object (to be used like the ``z`` ZFilter instance)
  - Waring-Lagrange polynomial interpolator StrategyDict
  - General resample based on Waring-Lagrange interpolators, working with
    time-varying sample rate
  - New methods ``Poly.is_polynomial()`` and ``Poly.is_laurent()``
  - New property ``Poly.order`` for common polynomials
  - Now ``Poly.integrate()`` and ``Poly.diff()`` methods returns Poly
    instances, and the ``zero`` from the caller Poly is always kept in
    result (this includes many bugfixes)
  - Poly instances are now better prepared for Stream coeffs and evaluation,
    including a helper ``Poly.copy()`` method
  - Poly is now hashable and have __setitem__ (using both isn't allowed for
    the same instance)

+ lazy_stream:

  - Stream.take now accepts floats, so with first ``sHz`` output as
    ``s`` (for second) you can now use ``my_stream.take(20 * s)`` directly,
    as well as a "take all" feature ``my_stream.take(inf)``
  - New ``Stream.peek()`` method, allowing taking items while keeping them
    as the next to be yielded by the Stream or StreamTeeHub
  - New ``Stream.skip()`` method for neglecting the leading items without
    storing them
  - New ``Stream.limit()`` method, to enforce a maximum "length"
  - StreamTeeHub methods ``skip()``, ``limit()``, ``append()``, ``map()`` and
    ``filter()`` returns the modified copy as a Stream instance (i.e., works
    like ``Stream(my_stream_tee_hub).method_name()``)
  - Control over the module name in ``tostream`` (needed for lazy_itertools)

+ lazy_synth:

  - Input "dur" in ``ones()``, ``zeros()``, ``white_noise()`` and
    ``impulse()`` now can be inf (besides None)
  - Impulse now have ``one=1.`` and ``zero=0.`` arguments
  - New ``gauss_noise`` for Normal / Gaussian-distributed noise
  - White-noise limits parametrization

+ lazy_text (*new!*):

  - Got all text/string formatting functions from lazy_misc
  - Namespace clean-up: new StrategyDict ``float_str`` embraces older
    rational/pi/auto formatters in one instance

  - Itemized package description, installation instructions and getting
    started examples with plots in README.rst
  - Now with 5400+ tests and 75% code coverage

+ lazy_analysis:

    filter to a MatPlotLib figure. Configurable:

    * Linear (*default*) or logarithmic frequency scale
    * Linear, squared or dB (*default*) magnitude scale
    * Plots together the DFT of a given block, if needed. Useful for LPC
    * Phase unwrapping (defaults to True)
    * Allows frequency in Hz and in rad/sample. When using radians units,
      the tick locator is based on ``pi``, as well as the formatter

  - New LinearFilter.zplot() for plotting the zero-pole plane of a LTI filter
    directly into a MatPlotLib figure
  - New LinearFilterProperties read-only properties ``numpolyz`` and
    ``denpolyz`` returning polynomials based on ``x = z`` instead of the
    polynomials based on ``x = z ** -1`` returned from ``numpoly`` and
    ``denpoly``
  - New LinearFilter properties ``poles`` and ``zeros``, based on NumPy
  - New class ``FilterList`` for filter grouping with a ``callables``
    property, for casting from lists with constant gain values as filters.
    It is an instance of ``FilterListMeta`` (old CascadeFilterMeta), and
    CascadeFilter now inherits from this FilterList
  - More LinearFilter behaviour into FilterList: Plotting (``plot`` and
    ``zplot``), ``poles``, ``zeros``, ``is_lti`` and ``is_causal``
  - New ``ParallelFilter`` class, inheriting from FilterList
  - Now comb is a StrategyDict too, with 3 strategies:

    * ``comb.tau``: Same to the feedback strategy, but with a time decay
      ``tau`` parameter (time in samples up to ``1/e`` amplitude, or
      -8.686 dB) instead of a gain ``alpha``
    * ``comb.ff``: Feed-forward comb filter (FIR or time variant)

    * ``levinson_durbin``: Same to the ``lpc.kautocor``, but with the
      autocorrelation vector as the input, not the signal data

  - Toeplitz matrix as a list of lists
  - Partial correlation coefficients (PARCOR) or reflection coefficients
  - Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF)
  - Stability testers for filters with LSF and PARCOR

+ lazy_math:

  - New ``rational_formatter``: casts floats to strings, perhaps with a symbol
    string as multiplier
  - New ``pi_formatter``: same to ``rational_formatter``, but with the symbol
    fixed to pi, mainly for use in MatPlotLib labels

+ lazy_poly:

  - New Poly.roots property, based on NumPy

+ lazy_stream:

  - Streamix class for mixing Streams based on delta starting times,
    automatically managing the need for multiple "tracks"

  - Three gammatone filter implementations: sampled impulse response, Slaney,
    Klapuri

+ lazy_core:

  - MultiKeyDict: an "inversible" dict (i.e., a dict whose values must be
    hashable) that may have several keys for each value
  - StrategyDict: callable dict to store multiple function implementations
    in. Inherits from MultiKeyDict, so the same strategy may have multiple
    names. It's also an iterable on its values (functions)

+ lazy_filters:

  - LTI and LTIFreq no longer exists! They were renamed to LinearFilter and
    ZFilter since filters now can have Streams as coefficients (they don't
    need to be "Time Invariant" anymore)
  - Linear filters are now iterables, allowing:

    * Comparison with almost_eq like ``assert almost_eq(filt1, filt2)``
    * Expression like ``numerator_data, denominator_data = filt``, where
      each data is a list of pairs that can be used as input for Poly,
      LinearFilter or ZFilter

  - LinearFilterProperties class, implementing numlist, denlist, numdict and
    dendict, besides numerator and denominator, from numpoly and denpoly
  - Comparison "==" and "!=" are now strict

+ lazy_math (*new!*):

  - dB10, dB20 functions for converting amplitude (squared or linear,
    respectively) to logarithmic dB (power) values from complex-numbers
    (like the ones returned by LinearFilter.freq_response)
  - Most functions from math module, but working decorated with elementwise
    (``sin``, ``cos``, ``sqrt``, etc.), and the constants ``e`` and ``pi``
  - Other functions: ``factorial``, ``ln`` (the ``log`` from math), ``log2``,

    to help working with Stream instances *almost* the same way as you do with
    numbers

+ general:

  - 4786 tests (including parametrized tests), based on pytest

+ lazy_core:

  - AbstractOperatorOverloaderMeta class to help massive operator
    overloading as needed by Stream, Poly and LTIFreq (now ZFilter) classes

+ lazy_filters:

  - LTI filters, callable objects with operators and derivatives, returning
    Stream instances
  - Explicit filter formulas with the ``z`` object, e.g.
    ``filt = 1 / (.5 + z ** -1)``

+ lazy_io:

  - Multi-thread audio playing (based on PyAudio), with context manager
    interface

+ lazy_itertools:

  - Stream-based version of all itertools

+ lazy_misc:

  - Block-based processing, given size and (optionally) hop
  - Simple zero padding generator
  - Elementwise decorator for functions
  - Bit-based and diff-based "almost equal" comparison function for floats
    and iterables with floats. Also works with (finite) generators

+ lazy_poly:

  - Poly: polynomials based on dictionaries, with list interface and
    operators

+ lazy_stream:

  - Stream: each instance is basically a generator with elementwise
    operators
  - Decorator ``tostream`` so generator functions can return Stream objects
